# Starting a Business (Step 1): Explore Your Motivations and Skills
### Goal: Decide that it’s worth the time and effort to move forward with this idea, or realize that starting a business is wrong for you.

Starting a business can be exciting and challenging, but it is also usually the riskiest of the four entrepreneurial options. Success requires more than the desire to have your own business and be your own boss. This Milestone is designed to help you sort out your skills and interests, so that you make an informed decision.
Starting a business from scratch offers you the potential for great financial reward, but it could also mean that you’ll lose everything. It is a life-altering decision, especially if you have never started or run a business on your own before. And if you have spent most of your career as an employee in an organization, you should be doubly cautious to carefully examine your motivations and skills before you decide to do this.
Knowing who you are, what you want, and why you want it, will propel you in the right direction. At the very beginning of your thinking about this option, you want to do some self-examination to consider:
* Your assets (both personal and financial)
* Your lifestyle needs
* Your support systems
Assessing your motivations, skills, interests, assets and liabilities will help you get a clearer picture of why you’re drawn to this possibility, what you bring to it, and where you may want to look for experienced assistance.
It’s the rare person who has all of the skills and ability to successfully start and run a business, and you don’t want to underestimate what it takes to succeed in a business start-up. People who know themselves well (and know when to call on others for help) are the ones most likely to succeed at this.
Questions to ask

* Why do I want to start my own business? Why am I considering starting a business from scratch rather than purchasing an ongoing business or buying a franchise? Why not work for someone else? What do I hope to gain, professionally and personally?
* Do I have all of the business skills, financial resources, and personal support to make a new business a success? What are my greatest strengths and assets? What are my most serious weaknesses and liabilities? What do I need to learn?
* Will I enjoy starting a business? Will the daily activities, challenges, and responsibilities satisfy me? Will I enjoy the lifestyle?
* How will my life be different? What will a typical day be like? A typical week? Will it be fun for me?
* How will my family, friends, business associates and others respond to this? What impact might this have on those relationships?
* What do I really know about starting a business? What reading or research have I done? Who have I talked to about this career option?
* Is this the right time in my life to pursue this option?
